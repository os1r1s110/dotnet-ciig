#### Why does this project exist? 

This project is initiated to help .NET developers understand the difference between collection interfaces by designing a series of question. It also assists people in choosing best interfaces for a method's return type and parameter type. 

#### Why interfaces only? Why not actual types?

When a method's parameter or return value has to be collection, we usually recommend developers to choose interfaces over actual types in order to reserve flexibility for refactoring.

#### Why aren't there immutable collection types? 

Because immutable collection types are still very young and not widely used in production. A few versions of .NET Framework/Standard later, we will introduce them to the project. 

#### Why generic only? 

Why not?
